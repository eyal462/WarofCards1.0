# WELCOME TO THE
# WAR OF CARDS 1.0
This is simple program of War of Cards
10 rounds of matches.
Each round, the program choose random card from the deck each player, higher card wins
The end match after 10 rounds, and announce the winner or tie
The only user interaction is choosing the number of cards each player get (10 - 26, no more or less, which doesn't matter at all because there is only 10 rounds regardless the number of cards each player get (which can't be below 10) so the only user interaction is pointless)

# GOOD LUCK!
# MAY THE BEST WIN!
(there is no actual winner)
